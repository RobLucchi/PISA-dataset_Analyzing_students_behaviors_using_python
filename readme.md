## Dataset

PISA dataset is a survey of student's skills and knowledge as they approach the end of 
compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how 
well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are 
for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of 
reading, mathematics, and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally.

I selected some features related to family status, working ethics, Teacher support, 
student view of the school, and attitudes to failer.

I have found an interesting relation between Family members not at home and Work Ethics 
and Teacher Support.
